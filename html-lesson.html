      The Blue Whales just played their first baseball game of the <em>new season</em>; I believe there is much to be excited about. Although they lost, it was against an excellent team that had won the championship last year. <strong>The Blue Whales fell behind early but showed excellent teamwork</strong> and came back to tie the game. The team had 15 hits and scored 8 runs. That’s excellent! Unfortunately, they had 5 fielding errors, which kept the other team in the lead the entire game. The game ended with the umpire making a bad call, and if the call had gone the other way, the Blue Whales might have actually won the game. It wasn’t a victory, but I say the Blue Whales look like they have a shot at the championship, especially if they continue to improve.
